### About Me

I'm currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript on my free-time. My goal is to consider my self good enough to build a professional website from start to finish.

This is my portfolio project.

### Future plans

-   Build an app with React
-   Start exploring other frameworks (eyeing Vue.js at the moment)
